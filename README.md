# hyper-health

This repository houses the components of my software engineering thesis project completed 

DISCLAIMER:
This system is meant to serve as proof that a blockchain environment could be used to mediate electronic health record (EHR) transactions and store/retrieve the data resulting from these transactions. Some elements of the system (specifically smart contract functions) are on par with a production system of this nature but as a whole, it lacks crucial functionalities that would enable deployment in a real-world environment.
